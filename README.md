## Insights

- Gender distribution is nearly balanced overall but tilts a bit slightly in favor of the Males, but there are 40          employees who didn't disclose their gender.
- Not Really, A significant number of employees are paid below the minimum wage requirement of $90,000.
- There is a measurable Gender pay gap in favor of the male employees. While the difference is modest, itâ€™s consistent     across most departments.The gap is widest in Business Development and Accounting.
- Bonus percentages vary by department and are tied to performance ratings.

##  Recommendations

- Promote gender balance in leadership roles.
- Review salaries by department and region, and focus on departments where a large number of employees are earning below   the expected threshold for further evaluation and possible adjustment.
- Assess the pay structure to confirm that positions of equal value receive fair and consistent compensation.
  Investigate whether pay discrepancies are tied to job grade, tenure, or performance, Ensure that gender is not a         factor in compensation decisions.
